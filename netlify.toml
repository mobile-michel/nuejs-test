[build]
  # This command tells Netlify how to build your NueJS site.
  # 'nue build' is a common command, but it might vary based on your project setup or NueJS version.
  # Refer to the NueJS documentation for the exact build command.
  command = "nue build"

  # This is the directory where NueJS outputs the built static files (HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc.).
  # NueJS typically outputs to a 'dist', 'public', or 'www' directory by default.
  # Check your NueJS project configuration or documentation for the correct directory.
  publish = "dist" # Or "public", "www", etc.

  # Optional: Specify the Node.js version if your NueJS build process requires a specific one.
  # [build.environment]
  #   NODE_VERSION = "18" # Or your desired Node.js version

# Optional: Redirects and rewrites
# You can define server-side redirects or rewrites here if needed.
# For example, for a Single Page Application (SPA) to handle client-side routing:
# [[redirects]]
#   from = "/*"
#   to = "/index.html"
#   status = 200

# Optional: Headers
# You can define custom HTTP headers for your site.
# [[headers]]
#   for = "/*"
#   [headers.values]
#     X-Frame-Options = "DENY"
#     X-XSS-Protection = "1; mode=block"
#     Content-Security-Policy = "default-src 'self'; img-src 'self' https:; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';"
#     Referrer-Policy = "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
#     Permissions-Policy = "geolocation=(), microphone=()"

# More complex build configurations or context-specific settings can also be added.
# For example, different settings for production vs. deploy previews:
# [context.production]
#   command = "nue build --production" # Example of a production-specific build command
#   publish = "dist"
#
# [context.deploy-preview]
#   command = "nue build --preview"
#   publish = "dist"

# Always refer to the latest Netlify and NueJS documentation for the most up-to-date configurations.
